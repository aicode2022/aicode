AI Code 2022 Website

I had manually added the folders, images and code on Github as I was unable to push due to permissions.
All the images  used in the website are in the img folder.
In order to committ some changes you can copy the code from index.html and edit it in your local editor i.e VS Code the copy all the code from your editor and then migrate to Github click on index.html then click on edit button present on top right corner. then select all the code using Ctrl+A then use backspace and remove everything and paste the entire code that you edited from VS Code usinf Ctrl+V and then scroll down and click commit changes.
After few seconds the website will be updated.
